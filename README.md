Description:
FoodMaster is a full-stack web application built at Carnegie Mellon University to help users discover restaurants and track nutrition. The project integrates multiple APIs (Spoonacular, Google Places, Nutritionix) and uses a Django backend with MySQL for data storage. The frontend is designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the app was deployed on AWS with Nginx, Daphne, and Certbot for secure production use.

Key features include:

Restaurant discovery with location-based search

Nutrition insights powered by third-party APIs

Secure backend with user accounts and data management

Production deployment with cloud infrastructure (AWS EC2, RDS, S3)

CI/CD setup and containerization for scalability
